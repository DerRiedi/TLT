# TLT

## Description

*TradeLikeTeletubbies* project is a little trading program that fetches some stock data from Yahoo Finance and saves it into
.csv files. Once the data is fetched, it can perform computations on it.

### Main Class description

- Teletubbie: is a stock tracker
- Executor: executes some tasks

## Features and Computations

- shabby little telegram bot: sends you notifications on tracked stock prices

## What could be done

- some exception handling (especially for historical data fetching)
- train bot (improve his communication skills, make him active only when stock markets are open)
- save the fetched intraday data into an other file (called say: "5_month_data") in order to perform some 5 month trading analysis
- add some cool new Teletubbie features

## Goal

One day, we could run this TLT project on a server H24. It will give us some trading advice, execute maybe some orders
automatically and what ever falls into my/your mind until then.
